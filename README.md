# CRUD-with-MSSQL-PHP-PDO-Bootstrap-Dynatable
Simple Cread, Read, Update and Delete from MSSQL server with PHP PDO and paggination, sorting, search filter and export in Excel file.
The script is made from couple other ready scripts. This is like all in one for my needs. I do not pretend for rights because i use already build code and i just complete it.
I`m open for comments to improve this code.
